## 📘 About

This repository contains my personal notes and thought process while performing a router upgrade as part of a **Cyber Essentials** compliance project. It's written from a real-world engineering perspective — focused on Cisco license handling (e.g., HSECk9-ALT), CLI configuration, and problem-solving under restricted conditions like airgapped environments.

These notes are shared publicly for reference and documentation purposes. They are not official Cisco documentation, but may help others dealing with similar challenges.
